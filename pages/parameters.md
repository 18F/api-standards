Common patterns:

* `page` and `per_page`. Intuitive for many use cases. Links to "page 2" may not always contain the same data.
* `offset` and `limit`. This standard comes from the SQL database world, and is a good option when you need stable permalinks to result sets.
* `since` and `limit`. Get everything "since" some ID or timestamp. Useful when it's a priority to let clients efficiently stay "in sync" with data. Generally requires result set order to be very stable.

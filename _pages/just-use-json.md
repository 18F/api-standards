title: "Just use JSON"
---

[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is an excellent, widely supported transport format, suitable for many web APIs.

Supporting JSON and only JSON is a practical default for APIs, and generally reduces complexity for both the API provider and consumer.

General JSON guidelines:

* Responses should be **a JSON object** (not an array). Using an array to return results limits the ability to include metadata about results, and limits the API's ability to add additional top-level keys in the future.
* **Don't use unpredictable keys**. Parsing a JSON response where keys are unpredictable (e.g. derived from data) is difficult, and adds friction for clients.
* **Use `under_score` case for keys**. Different languages use different case conventions. JSON uses `under_score`, not `camelCase`.

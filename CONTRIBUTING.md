## Contributing to GSA API Standards

These API Standards are intended to begin the discussion within GSA for API best practices. We invite all GSA developers to contribute to these standards and keep the conversation going.

### For the opening round of review (Jan 2017), we request that you:
1. Read the proposed GSA API standards in the [converting-gsa-standards](https://github.com/GSA/api-standards/tree/converting-gsa-standards) branch.
2. View the [files changed tab of the "Initial round of feedback on GSA API Standards"](https://github.com/GSA/api-standards/pull/7/files?diff=split) pull request to see how it has modified the 18F standards, from which it was forked.
3. Add your comments to individual changes by clicking the plus symbol beside any change that you would like to comment on.
4. When you have completed your review, select "Review changes" and submit your review with any general comments you would like to share.

## Alternate path: Github Issues:
If you are not familiar with the process of commenting on a pull request explained above, feel free to add issues directly in the github repo.


### During the review process, GSA Digital Services will:
- Respond to the comments.
- Immediately make some changes and commit to the "converting-gsa-standards" branch.

### At some point when initial feedback has been completed, GSA Digital Services will:
- Merge the pull request into the "master" branch...voila, we have GSA API standards.

(After this first round, this CONTRIBUTING policy will be updated to reflect the process for maintaining these going forward.)

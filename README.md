# 18F API Standards




## Guidelines

This document provides guidelines and examples for 18F Web APIs, encouraging consistency, maintainability, and best practices across applications. 18F APIs aim to balance a truly RESTful API interface with a positive developer experience (DX).

This document borrows heavily from:
* [Designing HTTP Interfaces and RESTful Web Services](http://munich2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/designing-http-interfaces-and-restful-web-services)
* [API Facade Pattern](http://apigee.com/about/content/api-fa%C3%A7ade-pattern), by Brian Mulloy, Apigee
* [Web API Design](http://pages.apigee.com/web-api-design-ebook.html), by Brian Mulloy, Apigee
* [Fielding's Dissertation on REST](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm)

## Pragmatic REST

These guidelines aim to support a truly RESTful API. Here are a few exceptions:
* Put the version number of the API in the URL (see examples below). Don’t accept any requests that do not specify a version number.
* Allow users to request formats like JSON or XML like this:
    * http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json
    * http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.xml

## RESTful URLs

### General guidelines for RESTful URLs
* A URL identifies a resource.
* URLs should include nouns, not verbs.
* Use plural nouns only for consistency (no singular nouns).
* Use HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to operate on the collections and elements.
* You shouldn’t need to go deeper than resource/identifier/resource.
* Put the version number at the base of your URL, for example http://example.com/v1/path/to/resource.
* URL v. header:
    * If it changes the logic you write to handle the response, put it in the URL.
    * If it doesn’t change the logic for each response, like OAuth info, put it in the header.
* Specify optional fields in a comma separated list.
* Formats should be in the form of api/v2/resource/{id}.json

### Good URL examples
* List of magazines:
    * GET http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json
* Filtering is a query:
    * GET http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json?year=2011&sort=desc
    * GET http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json?topic=economy&year=2011
* A single magazine in JSON format:
    * GET http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234.json
* All articles in (or belonging to) this magazine:
    * GET http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.json
* All articles in this magazine in XML format:
    * GET http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.xml
* Specify optional fields in a comma separated list:
    * GET http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234.json?fields=title,subtitle,date
* Add a new article to a particular magazine:
    * POST http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234/articles

### Bad URL examples
* Non-plural noun:
    * http://example.gov/magazine
    * http://example.gov/magazine/1234
    * http://example.gov/publisher/magazine/1234
* Verb in URL:
    * http://example.gov/magazine/1234/create
* Filter outside of query string
    * http://example.gov/magazines/2011/desc

## HTTP Verbs

HTTP verbs, or methods, should be used in compliance with their definitions under the [HTTP/1.1](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) standard.
The action taken on the representation will be contextual to the media type being worked on and its current state. Here's an example of how HTTP verbs map to create, read, update, delete operations in a particular context:

| HTTP METHOD | POST            | GET       | PUT         | DELETE |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| CRUD OP     | CREATE          | READ      | UPDATE      | DELETE |
| /dogs       | Create new dogs | List dogs | Bulk update | Delete all dogs |
| /dogs/1234  | Error           | Show Bo   | If exists, update Bo; If not, error | Delete Bo |

(Example from Web API Design, by Brian Mulloy, Apigee.)


## Responses

* No values in keys
* No internal-specific names (e.g. "node" and "taxonomy term")
* Metadata should only contain direct properties of the response set, not properties of the members of the response set

### Good examples

No values in keys:

    "tags": [
      {"id": "125", "name": "Environment"},
      {"id": "834", "name": "Water Quality"}
    ],


### Bad examples

Values in keys:

    "tags": [
      {"125": "Environment"},
      {"834": "Water Quality"}
    ],


## Error handling

Error responses should include a common HTTP status code, message for the developer, message for the end-user (when appropriate), internal error code (corresponding to some specific internally determined ID), links where developers can find more info. For example:

    {
      "status" : 400,
      "developerMessage" : "Verbose, plain language description of the problem. Provide developers
       suggestions about how to solve their problems here",
      "userMessage" : "This is a message that can be passed along to end-users, if needed.",
      "errorCode" : "444444",
      "moreInfo" : "http://example.gov/developer/path/to/help/for/444444,
       http://drupal.org/node/444444",
    }

Use three simple, common response codes indicating (1) success, (2) failure due to client-side problem, (3) failure due to server-side problem:
* 200 - OK
* 400 - Bad Request
* 500 - Internal Server Error


## Versions

* Never release an API without a version number.
* Versions should be integers, not decimal numbers, prefixed with ‘v’. For example:
    * Good: v1, v2, v3
    * Bad: v-1.1, v1.2, 1.3
* Maintain APIs at least one version back.


## Record limits

* If no limit is specified, return results with a default limit.
* To get records 51 through 75 do this:
    * http://example.gov/magazines?limit=25&offset=50
    * offset=50 means, ‘skip the first 50 records’
    * limit=25 means, ‘return a maximum of 25 records’

Information about record limits and total available count should also be included in the response. Example:

    {
        "metadata": {
            "resultset": {
                "count": 227,
                "offset": 25,
                "limit": 25
            }
        },
        "results": []
    }

## Always use SSL/HTTPS

Any new API should use and require encryption (SSL).

* **Security**: The contents of the request are encrypted across the Internet.
* **Authenticity**: A stronger guarantee that you're communicating with the real API.
* **Privacy**: Enhanced privacy for apps and users using the API. HTTP headers and query string parameters (among other things) will be encrypted.
* **Compatibility**: Broader client-side compatibility. For CORS requests to the API to work on HTTPS websites -- to not be blocked as mixed content -- those requests must be over HTTPS.

SSL should be configured using modern best practices, including ciphers that syupport [forward secrecy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy), and [HTTP Strict Transport Security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security). **This is not exhaustive**: use [SSL Labs](ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html) to evaluate an API's SSL configuration.

For an existing API that runs over plain HTTP, the first step is to add SSL support, and update the documentation to declare it the default, use it in examples, etc.

Then, evaluate the viability of disabling or redirecting plain HTTP requests. See [GSA/api.data.gov#34](https://github.com/GSA/api.data.gov/issues/34) for a discussion of some of the issues involved with transitioning from HTTP->HTTPS.

## CORS

For clients to be able to use your API from inside web browsers, the API must [enable CORS](http://enable-cors.org/).

For the simplest and most common use case, where the entire API should be accessible from inside the browser, enablign CORS is as simple as including this HTTP header in all responses:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

It's supported by [every modern browser](http://enable-cors.org/client.html), and will Just Work in many JavaScript clients, like [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

**What about JSONP?**

JSONP is [not secure or performant](https://gist.github.com/tmcw/6244497). If you must support IE8 or IE9, use Microsoft's [XDomainRequest](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/05/13/xdomainrequest-restrictions-limitations-and-workarounds.aspx?Redirected=true) object instead of JSONP. There are [libraries](https://github.com/mapbox/corslite) to help with this.
